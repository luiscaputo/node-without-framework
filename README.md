# Node.js Project without FRAMEWORK

This project is a minimalist Node.js application that leverages database connectivity to handle GET and POST methods, all achieved without the use of a specific web framework. The application employs Node.js to create a server, establish a connection with a database, and handle incoming GET requests for retrieving data. Additionally, it supports POST requests for submitting new data to the database. This lightweight implementation showcases the fundamental concepts of server-side programming and database interaction in a Node.js environment, highlighting the simplicity and versatility of Node.js without relying on a dedicated web framework.
